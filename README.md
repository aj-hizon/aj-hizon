# 👋 Hey there! I'm Aj.

#### 🚀 Frontend Developer | 📊 Momentum Crypto Trader | 🤖 Aspiring Data Scientist 

I'm a frontend developer with experience in the **MERN** stack and a cryptocurrency trader. Currently, I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science student at Pampanga State University, with a strong passion for data science and building impactful applications. I'm focused on projects involving AI, machine learning, and algorithm development to solve real-world problems. When I'm not coding, I enjoy trading crypto and studying market trends 💻📊.

Currently, I'm diving headfirst into:
- 🤖 **AI & Machine Learning**
- 📈 **Algorithm Development**
- 🌐 **Impactful Web Applications**

I believe in code that not only works but **matters**—solving real-world problems, one commit at a time. Whether it’s building something useful, optimizing performance, or just learning something new, I’m always up for the next big challenge.
